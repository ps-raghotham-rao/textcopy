https://github.com/junyanz (Official implementation in pytorch. And exact tensorflow ports by various users are given in other implementations section).
https://keras.io/examples/generative/cyclegan/ (This I need to check. They have used resnet architecture as in the paper. Also image size was given to model architecture explicitly).
https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/cyclegan (this is what we implemented and author gave the colab link and github code in their github page saying tensorflow core cyclegan tutorial).

https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix/issues/562 (Issue: Someone had asked about using the original image size. They said to make resize to None. But it is in pytorch. Will check similar in tf implementations.).

https://github.com/LynnHo/CycleGAN-Tensorflow-2 (They have also used resnet)
https://github.com/Ldpe2G/DeepLearningForFun/tree/master/Oneflow-Python/CycleGAN (Similar to pytorch implementation imagesize-and-crop option exist).
